# Perceptron-implementation-using-scikit-learn-and-Numpy
1. Using Scikit-learn

Scikit-learn already provides a built-in Perceptron model under sklearn.linear_model.Perceptron. It is an efficient implementation of the original Rosenblattâ€™s perceptron algorithm with some modern optimizations (like learning rate, regularization, and tolerance for convergence). You can use it just like logistic regression or SVM from sklearn.

ðŸ‘‰ Features:

Supports online learning (with partial_fit).

Works with dense and sparse feature matrices.

Useful for quick prototyping and baseline models.

2. Using NumPy (from scratch)

Building a perceptron manually with NumPy helps you understand the math and learning process:

Initialize weights (random or zeros).

Compute weighted sum (z = wÂ·x + b).

Apply step function (activation) to decide output (0/1).

Update weights using the perceptron learning rule:


Iterate over dataset for multiple epochs until convergence.

This version is slower than Scikit-learnâ€™s but gives a deep understanding of how perceptrons actually learn to classify linearly separable data.

So:
Use Scikit-learn if you want speed, efficiency, and integration into ML pipelines.
Use NumPy if you want to learn the fundamentals and see how weights evolve step by step.
